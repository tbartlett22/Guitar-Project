    "In this project, I will be modeling the pickup and tone knob of an electric guitar. The pickup is an application of Faraday's Law, while the tone knob is an alternating current RC circuit, where the power supply is the output of the pickup. This will be broken down into several components, the first of which is to model a single guitar string vibrating over a single coil pickup.\n",
    "The string will be modeled as a point-like magnetic dipole which has a moment of $1 \\text{ Am}^2$. The strength of the dipole is essentially arbitrary, since we only care about the rate of change in flux, which really only depends on the frequency of vibration.\n",
